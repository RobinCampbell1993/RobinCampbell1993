ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robin Campbell

Iâ€™m looking to transition into software development from science (genetics/microbiology) to pursue better employment opportunities and further my passions. I pride myself on my logical thinking and passion for learning new skills. 

Currently open to any and all opportunities in the software development space.

Iâ€™m currently learning Frontend web development through Scrimba (scrimba.com/learn/frontend), having already completed a year long course with a focus on Java and mobile development.

Feel free to contact me through github, or via email for more information about me!
