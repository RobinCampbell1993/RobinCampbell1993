ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RobinCampbell1993

Iâ€™m looking to transition into software development from science (genetics/microbiology) to pursue better employment opportunities and further my passions. I pride myself on my logical thinking and passion for learning new skills. 

Currently open to any and all opportunities in the software development space.

Iâ€™m currently learning Frontend web development through Scrimba (scrimba.com/learn/frontend), having already completed a year long course with a focus on mobile development.
